Importance of Comments in JavaScript:

Comments in JavaScript are essential for documenting code, making it more understandable and maintainable.
They provide context, explanations, and insights into the purpose of the code, aiding developers in collaboration and future reference.
Comments are not executed by the JavaScript engine, so they don't impact the code's functionality.
Examples of Comments:

1) Single-Line Comment:

Used for a brief comment on a single line.
E.g. // this is a single line comment 

2)Multi-Line Comment:

Used for more extensive comments spanning multiple lines.

E.g./* this is 
a multi-line comment */
