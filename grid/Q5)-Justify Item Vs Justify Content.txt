In CSS Grid, both justify-items and justify-self are used to control the horizontal alignment of grid items within their grid containers. However, they operate at different levels of the grid structure.

justify-items:

This property is applied to the grid container and defines the default horizontal alignment for all grid items.

justify-self:

This property is applied to individual grid items and allows you to override the default alignment set by justify-items.
