1) Position Relative (position: relative;):
When you apply position: relative; to an element, it retains its position within the normal document flow, meaning it still occupies space where it would have been if position were not applied.
However, you can use the top, right, bottom, and left properties to offset the element from its original position. These values are relative to the element's original position.
Elements with position: relative; can be used as reference points for absolutely positioned elements nested within them. In other words, child elements with position: absolute; will be positioned relative to the nearest ancestor with position: relative;.

2)Position Absolute (position: absolute;):
When you apply position: absolute; to an element, it is removed from the normal document flow, and its position is determined relative to the nearest ancestor with a positioning context. If there is no such ancestor, it will be positioned relative to the initial containing block (usually the viewport).
You can use the top, right, bottom, and left properties to specify exactly where the element should be positioned relative to its containing element with a positioning context.
Absolutely positioned elements overlap with other elements, and they do not affect the layout of neighboring elements.
