Precedence and Associativity of Operators in JavaScript:

Precedence: Determines the order in which operators are evaluated in an expression. Higher precedence operators are evaluated first.

Associativity: Defines the order of evaluation when operators of the same precedence appear in an expression. It can be left-to-right or right-to-left.

Importance of Understanding These Concepts:

Correct Expression Evaluation:

Knowing the precedence ensures that expressions are evaluated in the intended order, preventing unexpected results.
Avoiding Ambiguity:

Understanding associativity helps resolve ambiguity in expressions with operators of the same precedence.
Code Readability:

Proper use of precedence and associativity makes code more readable by conveying the intended order of operations.
